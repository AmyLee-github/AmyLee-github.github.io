##### Greetings🖐️

Hi, I'm Joy Lee, a master's student in Software Engineering class of 2023, MBTI: ISFJ, a gentle nurse💉, a guardian personality, located in🚩: Chongqing, hometown in Changsha, Hunan. My current research direction is **computer vision - image classification - deepfake detection**. Welcome to communicate with me if you have the same direction🤗~

##### About CS💻

My undergraduate major was not related to computer science. I studied a very niche engineering major - Printing Engineering, which many people probably haven't heard of😂. Because I had some computer-related courses during my undergraduate studies, I teamed up with computer science students to participate in competitions in my junior year. At that time, I was responsible for the "so-called" UI design (although I was not professional). Gradually, I got more in touch with computers and started tinkering with my own computer. I was fiddling with the Windows system at that time and became a Microsoft fan. Then I decided to take the postgraduate entrance exam and chose to cross-apply for a computer-related major. Finally, I got into Software Engineering and am now studying a major I love. I feel very happy now!🥳

##### About the Blog📄

The reason for building this personal blog platform is that I usually like to take notes. I thought: "Since I need to record knowledge anyway, why not share it instead of just keeping it on my computer? This way, I can also help those in need, achieving two goals with one action." Also, as programmers know, **writing a personal blog is a long-term beneficial thing**, so I want to try to start doing this, integrating it into my daily study and life, forming a habit, and sticking to it.

As for what I plan to record in my blog, I currently think of recording some bug solutions I encounter, notes from reading papers, and possibly some random thoughts. After all, this is my world where I can fully express and create!🤠 I believe that no matter what you do or how you do it, **taking action is the most important thing**.😁
