# 1. How to save a specific file from a historical commit in the local repository to the current state?

### Method: Use the `git checkout` command

1. **Find the hash of the target commit**

  - Use the `git log` command to view the commit history and locate the hash of the target commit. For example:

    ```bash
    git log
    ```

    Assume the hash of the target commit is `abc123`.

2. **Check out the target file from the historical commit to the current working directory**

  - Use the `git checkout` command, specifying the hash of the target commit and the file path. For example:

    ```bash
    git checkout abc123 -- path/to/your/file
    ```

    This will check out the file `path/to/your/file` from the target commit into the corresponding location in the current working directory.
